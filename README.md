# plantSitter
With all honesty, I have been a terrible plant dad in the past. I used to have a Lily plant called Lillard which I adopted out of Netto (a German grocery store engrained in my heart, regardless of the very mean Nettofrauen), and it survived for a bit until falling victim to my neglect and poor watering. Ever since, I vouched to respect Lillard’s memory by not owning more indoor plants just to let them die. Fast forward to now, a friend has graduated and is moving out, and as I’m helping her, I accept a Furry Feather Calathea. And, as per my vouch to Lillard, I will do what I can to properly nurture Calathius (yes, I have named it Calathius, not to mention, I also have a basil plant called Basilson).
